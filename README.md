# Xylophone

## What you will create

You will be making your first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. So in this module, weâ€™re going to make a colourful XyloPhone app. Get it? Ok, the jokes are bad, but remember, I only wrote the good ones... 

```
import UIKit
import AVFoundation

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    var player: AVAudioPlayer!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    @IBAction func keyPressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        playSound()
    }
    
    func playSound() {
        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "C", withExtension: "wav")
        player = try! AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url!)
        player.play()
                
    }
}
```
